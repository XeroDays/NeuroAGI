## Workflows

### App startup

1. `npm start` → `scripts/start-electron.js` spawns Electron
2. `src/main/index.js` runs: loads `.env` via `dotenv`, hides menu, registers IPC handlers, creates main window
3. `main-window.js` creates BrowserWindow (hidden), loads `src/renderer/index.html`, shows on `ready-to-show`

### Home screen → Questionnaire navigation

1. On load, `app.js` auto-focuses the health input (`input.focus()` after age dropdown is populated; the input also has the `autofocus` attribute as a fallback)
2. User types health issue in text input, selects gender and age from dropdowns
3. Clicks the submit button (arrow icon) **or** presses **Ctrl+Enter** / **Cmd+Enter** while the health input has focus — `app.js` listens for the shortcut on the input and synthesises a click on the submit button
4. `app.js` builds query string (`?issue=...&gender=...&age=...`) and navigates to `screens/questionnaire/index.html` (no IPC call from home — avoids freezing while LLM responds)

### Settings (gear icon) → DevTools toggle

1. Home screen renders a fixed glass gear icon in the top-right (`#btn-settings` in `src/renderer/index.html`)
2. Click handler in `app.js` calls `window.electronAPI.openDevTools()`
3. Preload invokes IPC channel `OPEN_DEV_TOOLS`
4. `register.js` handler resolves the calling `BrowserWindow` via `BrowserWindow.fromWebContents(event.sender)` and calls `win.webContents.toggleDevTools()` — clicking again hides DevTools

### Questionnaire screen → LLM question generation

1. `questionnaire.js` on `DOMContentLoaded` reads `issue`, `gender`, `age` from URL params, fills the summary, and shows a `Loading questions…` status
2. It calls `window.electronAPI.startReportCollection({ issue, gender, age })` → IPC `START_REPORT_COLLECTION`
3. Main process: `register.js` invokes `StartReportcollection()` in `collector-middleware.js`
4. The middleware builds the initial intake prompt via `GenerateQuestionnaireLLMQuery()`. It then runs a **two-stage AGI pipeline** instead of a single LLM call:
   - **Stage 1 — Fanout**: `AskAllWorkerAgis(prompt)` in `agi-service.js` issues `chatCompletion(messages, model)` calls in parallel (`Promise.allSettled`) to every model in `OPENROUTER_WORKER_MODELS`. Each result is shaped uniformly: `{ model, ok, content?, error? }` — a single worker 429/network/HTTP failure doesn't abort the others.
   - **Per-worker parse**: each `ok: true` worker response goes through the tiered `parseJsonArray` (see below). Workers that fail to parse are logged and dropped; workers that succeeded are collected into an array of parsed questionnaire arrays.
   - **All-fail guard**: if zero workers succeeded (no parseable JSON from anyone), the middleware throws → renderer shows the centered red Retry button.
   - **Stage 2 — Master merge**: `GenerateMergeQuestionnaireLLMQuery(parsedSets)` builds a prompt that asks the master model to consolidate the worker outputs (dedupe by intent, union MCQ options keeping "Other" last, prefer the clearer slider/range labels, drop low-value questions, never invent new clinical territory). `AskMasterAgi(prompt)` calls `chatCompletion` against `OPENROUTER_MASTER_MODEL` (`nvidia/nemotron-3-nano-30b-a3b:free`).
5. The master's raw response is run through the same **three-tier parser** as the worker responses:
   - **Tier 1 — strict `JSON.parse`** (happy path; no extra cost when the model returns clean JSON)
   - **Tier 2 — normalize then `JSON.parse`** (replaces smart quotes with ASCII, strips `//` and `/* */` comments, removes trailing commas)
   - **Tier 3 — `jsonrepair` then `JSON.parse`** (handles broader structural damage)
   On any tier failure the parser logs an 80-char window around the bad character; if all three tiers fail the full raw response is logged and an error propagates. On success the middleware returns `{ ok: true, issue, gender, age, questions }`; on failure it returns `{ ok: false, error }`
6a. **Failure → Retry**: when the IPC returns `{ ok: false }` (e.g. all workers 429'd, master parsing exhausted, network error), the questionnaire screen swaps the centered status overlay to a friendly message (translated by `humanizeError()` — 429 → "The AI service is temporarily rate-limited…", network errors → "Network error reaching the AI service…") plus a **red Retry button**. The button just calls `window.location.reload()`, which restarts the whole flow from scratch (re-fires `DOMContentLoaded`, re-spawns the spinner, re-invokes IPC, and re-runs the full fanout-merge pipeline)
6. `questionnaire.js` hides the status box, reveals `#q-form`, and renders one `<section class="q-card q-card--{type}">` per question with type-specific controls; reveals the Submit button
7. Submit click collects all answers (`{ question, type, value }[]`), then proceeds to the next workflow

### Questionnaire submit → Laboratory screen

1. User clicks Submit on the questionnaire; `questionnaire.js` collects answers via `collectAnswers(formEl)` and disables the button (label switches to `Submitting…`)
2. Renderer calls `window.electronAPI.submitQuestionnaire({ issue, gender, age, questions, answers })` → IPC `SUBMIT_QUESTIONNAIRE`
3. Main process: `register.js` invokes `SubmitQuestionnaire()` in `collector-middleware.js`
4. The middleware logs a structured Q&A dump to the main-process console (one `Q{n} [type] text` line and one `A{n}: value` line per question, framed by `=== Q&A dump ===` markers) and returns `{ ok: true }`
5. The renderer stashes `{ issue, gender, age, questions, answers }` into `sessionStorage['neuroagi:questionnaire']` (per-tab; cleared when the Electron window closes) — this is the handoff channel for the bulky Q&A payload, which is too large for a URL query string
6. The renderer navigates to `screens/laboratory/index.html?issue=…&gender=…&age=…` (only `issue/gender/age` ride in the URL so a refresh still has the basics); on failure the Submit button re-enables and the centered error card appears

### Laboratory screen → LLM lab-test generation

1. `laboratory.js` on `DOMContentLoaded` reads `issue/gender/age` from URL params, then reads `sessionStorage['neuroagi:questionnaire']` and JSON-parses it for the intake `questions`/`answers`
2. If the sessionStorage payload is missing or malformed (e.g. user opened the URL directly), `laboratory.js` shows the same centered red-card error as the questionnaire with the message `Missing questionnaire data. Please restart from the home screen.` (Retry just reloads; user can click the header Back link to return home)
3. It calls `window.electronAPI.gotoLaboratory({ issue, gender, age, questions, answers })` → IPC `GOTO_LABORATORY`
4. Main process: `register.js` invokes `GotoLaboratory()` in `collector-middleware.js`, which mirrors `StartReportcollection`'s **two-stage AGI pipeline** but with a different initial prompt:
   - **Initial prompt**: `GenerateLaboratoryLLMQuery({ issue, gender, age, questions, answers })` builds a clinical-pathologist persona prompt that serializes the intake Q&A and asks the worker models to propose lab tests / imaging studies, emitting one question per test (using the same `single_select` / `multi_select` / `slider` / `range` / `text` schema) so the patient can fill in the result they got from their report
   - **Fanout**: identical to questionnaire — `AskAllWorkerAgis` across `OPENROUTER_WORKER_MODELS` with `Promise.allSettled`
   - **Per-worker tiered parse**: identical (strict → normalize → jsonrepair), failures logged and dropped
   - **All-fail guard**: if zero workers succeed, throws → renderer shows centered red Retry button
   - **Master merge**: reuses the existing `GenerateMergeQuestionnaireLLMQuery` prompt (it is generic over question arrays of the standard schema, no laboratory-specific variant needed). `AskMasterAgi` against `OPENROUTER_MASTER_MODEL` produces the final consolidated list of result-input questions
5. The master response is parsed with the same tiered `parseJsonArray`; success returns `{ ok: true, issue, gender, age, questions }`, failure returns `{ ok: false, error }`
6. `laboratory.js` renders the returned lab questions through duplicated `buildCard` / `renderSingleSelect` / `renderMultiSelect` / `renderSlider` / `renderRange` / `renderText` / `collectAnswers` helpers (verbatim copies from `questionnaire.js`, kept duplicated by design so the questionnaire screen isn't affected) — class names stay `.q-*` so `questionnaire.css` styles apply unchanged
7. The same `showError` / `humanizeError` retry path is reused: on `{ ok: false }` or any thrown error the centered red Retry button reloads the page and re-runs the lab fanout-merge

### Laboratory submit → Doctor screen

1. User clicks Submit on the laboratory; `laboratory.js` collects answers via the duplicated `collectAnswers` and disables the button (label switches to `Submitting…`)
2. Renderer calls `window.electronAPI.submitLaboratory({ issue, gender, age, questions, answers })` → IPC `SUBMIT_LABORATORY`
3. Main process: `register.js` invokes `SubmitLaboratory()` in `collector-middleware.js`, which logs a structured lab Q&A dump (one `Q{n} [type] text` / `A{n}: value` per question, framed by `=== Lab Q&A dump ===` markers, tagged `[collector/lab]`) and returns `{ ok: true }`
4. On success the renderer navigates to `screens/doctor/index.html?issue=…&gender=…&age=…`; on failure the Submit button re-enables and the centered error card appears
5. `doctor.js` reads the URL params and renders the patient summary; the body is a placeholder card ("We're consulting the doctor") pending the next step (e.g. diagnostic report generation). The Back link in the doctor header points to the **home screen** (`../../index.html`), not back to the laboratory — going back to a stale lab page would re-trigger the LLM and confuse the user

**Per-card "I have this report" toggle (lab-only).** Every lab card emitted by `laboratory.js#buildCard` is prepended with a `.q-report-toggle` pill switch (markup: `<label class="q-report-toggle"><input data-report-toggle="1" role="switch" checked>...<span class="q-report-toggle-text">I have this report already</span></label>`), default **on**. The toggle's `change` handler flips a `.q-card--no-report` class on the card and calls `setCardInputsDisabled(card, !checked)` which sets `disabled = true` on every `input`/`textarea`/`select` inside the card (the toggle itself is excluded via the `[data-report-toggle="1"]` selector). The label text swaps between `I have this report already` and `I don't have this report`. `.q-card--no-report` in `questionnaire.css` dims the question heading and every input wrapper to `opacity: 0.45` + `pointer-events: none`, while explicitly keeping the toggle row fully interactive so the user can flip it back. On submit, `collectAnswers` short-circuits any card whose toggle is unchecked and pushes `{ question, type, value: "the user does not have this report currently" }` regardless of question type — so `multi_select` answers normally typed `string[]` and `range` answers normally typed `{ min, max }` become a plain string for that card. Downstream consumers (`SubmitLaboratory` log, future doctor screen) should test `answer.value === "the user does not have this report currently"` before doing any type-specific handling.

### Adding a new IPC channel

1. Add channel name to `src/shared/ipc/channels.js`
2. Mirror the channel name in `src/preload/index.js` (preload cannot reliably require shared modules with sandbox)
3. Add handler in `src/main/ipc/register.js`
4. Expose method via `contextBridge` in preload

### Adding a new screen

1. Create `src/renderer/screens/<name>/index.html`
2. Reference styles with `../../styles/` paths
3. Add screen script in `src/renderer/scripts/`
4. Navigate from other screens via relative HTML paths

## LLM prompts

### `GenerateQuestionnaireLLMQuery({ issue, gender, age })`

**File:** `src/main/helpers/query-generator-helper.js`

Builds the prompt that asks an LLM to generate medical intake follow-up questions based on the user's initial issue, age, and gender. Inputs are sanitized: missing/empty `issue` falls back to `"an unspecified health issue"`, `gender` defaults to `"male"`, `age` defaults to `"30"`.

**Persona:** highly experienced medical doctor, licensed physician, PhD-level clinical specialist.

**Task:** generate intelligent, medically relevant follow-up questions covering symptoms, history, severity, triggers, duration, lifestyle, medications, and risk indicators.

**Allowed question types:** `single_select`, `multi_select`, `slider`, `range`, `text`.

**Rules baked into the prompt:**
- Selectable questions must include an `"Other"` option
- Some questions should use sliders for severity / emotional state
- Some should allow multi-symptom selection
- Include duration, frequency, pain level, mood, sleep, stress where relevant
- No duplicates, no padding — only medically meaningful questions
- Adapt dynamically to the reported issue
- Injects the current request date/time ("For awareness, the current date and time of this request is …") right after the patient line, formatted via `toLocaleString('en-US', …)` with weekday, full date, hour/minute and short timezone — gives the model temporal context for symptom recency / seasonality without prompting it to confirm the date with the user
- **Units are mandatory on any measurable question.** Quantitative answers (duration, frequency, length, weight, distance, temperature, count, dose, etc.) must state the unit in the question text (preferred) or in both `labels.min` / `labels.max` for slider/range types. Slider/range bounds must be clinically reasonable for the chosen unit (e.g. pain 0–10 not 0–100; heart rate 30–220 not 0–1000). Numeric `single_select` / `multi_select` options must carry units (`"30 minutes"`, not `"30"`). A second worked JSON example was added to the prompt body — a headache-duration slider with `min: 0, max: 1440, step: 5, labels.min: "0 min", labels.max: "24 h"` — so the model anchors on a unit-bearing slider shape

**Output contract:** the LLM must return **only** a valid JSON array (no markdown, no comments, no explanations). Example shapes:

```json
[
  {
    "question": "How severe is your pain currently?",
    "type": "slider",
    "min": 0,
    "max": 10,
    "step": 1,
    "labels": { "min": "No pain", "max": "Worst pain" }
  },
  {
    "question": "Which symptoms are you experiencing?",
    "type": "multi_select",
    "options": ["Fever", "Headache", "Fatigue", "Nausea", "Other"]
  }
]
```

**Consumers:** wired through `src/main/middlewares/collector-middleware.js`. `StartReportcollection({ issue, gender, age })` builds this prompt and sends it to **all worker models in parallel** via `AskAllWorkerAgis()` in `src/main/services/agi-service.js` (which uses `chatCompletion(messages, model)` from `api-helper.js`). Each worker response is parsed through the tiered parser; the surviving parsed arrays are then fed into `GenerateMergeQuestionnaireLLMQuery(...)` and sent to the master model via `AskMasterAgi()`. The final master JSON is parsed and returned over IPC to `src/renderer/scripts/questionnaire.js` which renders one card per question.

### `GenerateMergeQuestionnaireLLMQuery({ questionnaireSets })`

**File:** `src/main/helpers/query-generator-helper.js`

Builds the prompt the **master model** (`OPENROUTER_MASTER_MODEL` in `agi-service.js`, currently `nvidia/nemotron-3-nano-30b-a3b:free`) uses to consolidate the per-worker questionnaires into a single deduplicated set.

**Persona:** experienced medical doctor + clinical assessment designer (kept consistent with the intake prompt).

**Inputs serialized into the prompt:**
- The current request date/time (same `toLocaleString` format as the intake prompt, for awareness only).
- All worker questionnaires, each labelled `Source 1`, `Source 2`, … with `JSON.stringify(set, null, 2)` of the parsed JSON array.
- A repeat of the schema reference: `{ question, type, options?, min?, max?, step?, labels? }` with allowed `type` values.

**Rules baked into the prompt:**
- Combine into ONE consolidated, deduplicated questionnaire.
- Treat questions with the same clinical intent as duplicates even if worded differently — merge them.
- Selectable types (single_select, multi_select): take the union of options, remove near-duplicates (case- and punctuation-insensitive). Always keep `"Other"` as the last option.
- Slider / range: prefer the most clinically reasonable `min`/`max`/`step`, reuse the clearer label text.
- Drop low-value, redundant, or trivially similar questions; keep only medically meaningful ones.
- Maintain a healthy mix of question types where appropriate.
- Do NOT invent new clinical territory the sources didn't cover.
- **Final validation pass** over every merged question before emitting. Checklist baked into the prompt body: clarity (self-contained, unambiguous); units mandatory on every measurable quantity, auto-add the most clinically reasonable unit if a sourced question is missing one; clinically sensible slider/range bounds (e.g. pain capped to 0–10, heart rate capped to 30–220, episode duration in minutes capped to 1440) with a sensible `step` for the unit; option coherence (mutually exclusive for `single_select`, non-redundant for `multi_select`, `"Other"` last, numeric options carry units); single intent (split or drop double-barreled questions); type-fit (e.g. yes/no questions typed as `text` get rewritten to `single_select` with `["Yes", "No", "Other"]`). Model is told to **fix before dropping** — rewording, retyping, and bound/unit adjustment are preferred to discarding a question outright.

**Output contract:** the master model must return **only** a valid JSON array in the exact same schema as the worker outputs — no markdown fences, comments, explanations, or surrounding text. The same tiered `parseJsonArray` recovers from minor formatting issues.

### `GenerateLaboratoryLLMQuery({ issue, gender, age, questions, answers })`

**File:** `src/main/helpers/query-generator-helper.js`

Builds the prompt that asks the **worker models** to propose laboratory tests / imaging studies for the patient case, then emit ONE question per test using the **same schema** as the intake questionnaire so the patient can enter the value they got from their report. Inputs are sanitized the same way as the intake prompt (`issue` falls back to `"an unspecified health issue"`, `gender` defaults to `"male"`, `age` defaults to `"30"`).

**Persona:** highly experienced licensed physician + clinical pathologist (lab medicine specialist).

**Inputs serialized into the prompt:**
- Patient summary line (`${age}-year-old ${gender}` + reported issue).
- Current request date/time (same `toLocaleString` format as the other helpers, for awareness only).
- Intake Q&A block — for each `questions[i]` / `answers[i]` pair, one stanza of the form:

  ```
  Q{n} [type] {question text}
  A{n}: {value}
  ```

  Array values are joined with `, `, object values are `JSON.stringify`-ed, missing answers render as `(no answer)`, empty multi-selects render as `(none selected)`.

**Type-selection rules baked into the prompt:**
- Continuous numeric result with a clinical range → `slider` with sensible `min`/`max`/`step` and `labels.min` / `labels.max` like `"Low"` / `"High"`.
- Numeric pair (reference-range style) → `range`.
- Categorical / graded / staged result → `single_select` (always end with `"Other"`).
- Imaging checklist (multiple findings can co-occur) → `multi_select` (always end with `"Other"`).
- Free-form descriptive finding → `text`.

**Worked examples baked into the prompt body** (to anchor the model on shape, with explicit instruction to only use them if clinically appropriate):
- Low-libido case → `{ "question": "Total testosterone (ng/dL)", "type": "slider", "min": 0, "max": 1500, "step": 10, "labels": { "min": "Very low", "max": "Very high" } }`
- Varicocele case → `{ "question": "Ultrasound varicocele grade", "type": "single_select", "options": ["Grade I", "Grade II", "Grade III", "Grade IV", "Other"] }`

**Other rules:**
- Prioritise medically meaningful, first-line tests for this case.
- Do not invent obscure or irrelevant tests.
- No duplicate questions.
- A small focused panel is acceptable — do not pad.

**Output contract:** must return **only** a valid JSON array in the exact same schema as `GenerateQuestionnaireLLMQuery` — no markdown fences, comments, explanations, or surrounding text. The same tiered `parseJsonArray` recovers from minor formatting issues.

**Consumers:** wired through `src/main/middlewares/collector-middleware.js#GotoLaboratory`. Runs through the same two-stage AGI pipeline as the intake (worker fanout → per-worker tiered parse → drop failures → reuse `GenerateMergeQuestionnaireLLMQuery` → master merge → final parse). The resulting JSON array is returned over IPC to `src/renderer/scripts/laboratory.js`, which renders it with the same `.q-*` card UI as the questionnaire.

## Design

### Home screen (`app.css`)

| Element | Style |
|---------|-------|
| **Background** | Soft pastel gradient (pink → lavender → light blue, `135deg`); subtle radial glow overlay |
| **Title** | White, centered, responsive clamp sizing, text-shadow for depth |
| **Text input** | Solid white, rounded rectangle (`14px`), soft shadow, dark text; 80% viewport width |
| **Submit button** | Dark rounded square (`10px`) inside input, right-aligned; white arrow SVG icon; no hover animation |
| **Dropdowns (gender/age)** | Frosted translucent white (`rgba(255,255,255,0.65)`), rounded (`10px`), grey text, custom SVG chevron; right-aligned below input, auto-width |
| **Dropdown options** | White background, light purple highlight on selected |
| **Settings (gear) icon** | Fixed `top: 1rem; right: 1rem`, `2.5rem` glass circle (`var(--glass-bg-strong)` + 18px blur, white border, soft shadow); rotates 30deg on hover; click toggles DevTools via IPC `OPEN_DEV_TOOLS` |

### Questionnaire + Laboratory screen (`questionnaire.css`)

Pastel-gradient theme aligned with the **Home screen** (`app.css`) — same background, glassmorphism, and accent purple. The form is a **responsive CSS Grid** that auto-arranges question cards of varying widths, edge-to-edge across the full window width. The Laboratory screen (`screens/laboratory/index.html`) links this same stylesheet and uses the same `.q-*` class structure — only the loading copy differs (`Loading laboratory tests…` instead of `Loading questions…`).

| Element | Style |
|---------|-------|
| **Background** | Same pastel gradient as home (pink → lavender → light blue, `135deg`); subtle radial glow overlay |
| **Text color** | White primary (`rgba(255,255,255,0.96)`), white-muted secondary; text shadows for readability over the gradient |
| **Header** | Glass bar (`rgba(255,255,255,0.1)` + 18px blur), Back link as a glass pill on the left, centered brand + screen subtitle |
| **Layout** | Edge-to-edge — no `max-width` cap, `1rem` horizontal padding only |
| **Grid** | `display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(220px, 1fr)); grid-auto-flow: dense; gap: 1rem;` |
| **Card width per type** | `single_select` → `span 1`; `multi_select`, `slider`, `range`, `text` → `span 2`; below `520px` all collapse to full width |
| **Card** | Glass: `rgba(255,255,255,0.14)` background + 18px blur, white border, soft shadow + inner highlight, `14px` radius |
| **Question heading** | `0.95rem`, semibold, white with subtle text shadow |
| **Option row (radio/checkbox)** | Solid white-translucent (`rgba(255,255,255,0.55)`) pill, dark-grey label text, `10px` radius; hover brightens; native control uses purple accent (`#b48cd2`) |
| **"Other" option (single_select only)** | Replaces the visible label with a dashed-underline text input; typing in it auto-checks the paired hidden radio and uses the typed text as the value |
| **Text input / textarea** | Solid white, no border, `12px` radius, soft shadow; focus ring uses purple accent |
| **Slider** | Native `<input type="range">` with purple accent, live numeric value on the right (white), optional `labels.min` / `labels.max` under the track |
| **Range (two thumbs)** | **Dual-thumb single-track slider** — two overlapping `<input type="range">` sharing one visual track with a purple fill between the thumbs; each thumb is clamped so it can't cross the other (with a z-index nudge so neither thumb gets stuck when they collide at the upper bound); bound labels below the track show the absolute `min`/`max` from the model, a second row below shows live `Min: X` / `Max: Y`; final value still emitted as `{ min, max }` on collect via the unchanged `q_{i}_min` / `q_{i}_max` input names |
| **Submit** | Dark pill button (`#555`, white text), right-aligned at the end of the grid; lifts on hover; disables itself after click |
| **Status / error** | Centered glass card; error state tinted soft red |
| **Lab per-card toggle** | Pill switch at the top of every laboratory card — purple track (`#b48cd2`) with white thumb when ON, white-translucent track when OFF; default ON ("I have this report already"), OFF reads "I don't have this report"; when OFF the rest of the card dims to `opacity: 0.45` with `pointer-events: none` and every input/textarea is `disabled`. Only emitted on laboratory cards because only `laboratory.js` renders the `.q-report-toggle` markup; the questionnaire screen is unaffected even though the CSS lives in the shared `questionnaire.css` |

## Security

- `contextIsolation: true`, `nodeIntegration: false`
- CSP: `default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'`
- API keys stay in main process only (never in renderer or preload source)
- IPC channels centralized in `src/shared/ipc/channels.js`; preload mirrors them
- All file paths use `path.join(__dirname, ...)` for spaces and packaging compatibility
